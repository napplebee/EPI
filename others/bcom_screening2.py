Anagrams

An anagram is a word that can be written as a permutation of the characters of another word, like "dirty room" and "dormitory" (ignore spaces).
However, "the" and "thee" are not anagrams, since "the" only has a single "e" whereas "thee" has two "e" characters (spaces can occur zero, or multiple times, however).
Given a list of strings of unknown length, one string per line, you should output groups of the provided words that are mutual anagrams.
Output one group per line and separate the strings in each group by commas.
Within a line, the expressions should be sorted lexicographically. If a group contains only a single element, output that one-element group on a single line. And the lines should also be output in lexicographical order.

Given e.g. :
pear
amleth
dormitory
tinsel
dirty room
hamlet
listen
silent

... the output would be:
amleth,hamlet
dirty room,dormitory
listen,silent,tinsel
pear
